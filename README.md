# DFC connector TypeScript source code generator

This repository contains Eclipse and Acceleo framework files to generate the DFC connector in the TypeScript programming language.

## What is the DFC connector?

The DFC connector is a tool designed to help developers implement the [DFC standard](https://datafoodconsortium.org) in their applications. It provides a data model (abstraction layer) to easily express semantic data conforming to the DFC ontology. The connector thus hides the complexity of creating a semantic application because developers do not need to acquire any particular semantic web skills.
